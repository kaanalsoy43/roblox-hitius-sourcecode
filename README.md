# Roblox Hitius Source Code

This repository contains fixed hitius source code that can be compiled.<br>
Acquired from web archive and brought to you in Github!<br>
ui0ppk has an broken hitius source code, this is the original hitius version so its fixed.

Libraries are excluded as a .7z file because of the size. See the down below for more information.

## Build

You will need the following to compile, for Windows:
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16)
   - You need these Components:
      1. Windows XP Support for C++
      2. Visual Studio 2015 Build Tools (v140_xp or v140)
      3. C++ MFC for x86 and x64
      4. C++ ATL for x86 and x64
      5. Desktop Development with C++ from Workloads
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (Optional)
- [Library.7z](https://mega.nz/file/eyQyWaiL) - Exluded Libraries
   - Encrpytion Key: `JyaWhnQ6MrvdF5h03ts_4ingrVQzBIcEV4NpU1tcUTY`

### Setting up Libraries

1. Create a folder named "Library" to the root
2. Unzip the Library.7z to the "Library" folder that you created and then continue reading the tutorial.

### Boost
1. Run `bootstrap.bat` in `Library/boost/`. Edit the paths in `build_boost.bat` to correspond to where you are keeping this repository, and run `build_boost.bat`
2. Congratulations! You've built boost.

### Qt
1. This is where the necessity of the Visual Studio 2015 build tools becomes apparent. You will need to open the VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt (search VS2015 in your Start Menu.)
2. Set your current directory to this repositorys Library/Qt folder.
3. Run the following command, substituting "${path}" for where you are keeping this repository.
```sh
configure -make nmake -platform win32-msvc2015 -prefix ${path}\Library\Qt -opensource -confirm-license -opengl desktop -nomake examples -nomake tests -webkit -xmlpatterns
```
4. Example command if I kept the repository in `D:\Roblox\Source`:
```sh
configure -make nmake -platform win32-msvc2015 -prefix D:\Roblox\Source\Library\Qt -opensource -confirm-license -opengl desktop -nomake examples -nomake tests -webkit -xmlpatterns
```
5. That will configure everything. Once it is finished, run `nmake`. If you get an error for `rc` not being recognized, add your SDK to PATH.
6. It should eventually stop and break somewhere, but by that time, you will have all the libraries you need.
7. Congratulations! You *partially* compiled Qt.

### Main Roblox projects
Simply open up Roblox.sln and build. Everything listed as able to compile will compile, unless you're doing something wrong.
